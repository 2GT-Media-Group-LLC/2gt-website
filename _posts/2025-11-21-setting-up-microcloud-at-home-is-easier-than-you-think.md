# Canonical MicroCloud Setup and Walkthrough Summary

## 🧩 Overview
- **MicroCloud** is a lightweight, self-hosted private cloud by Canonical (the makers of Ubuntu).  
- It combines **LXD**, **MicroCeph**, and **MicroOVN** into one automated stack.  
- Designed for **edge computing**, **homelabs**, and **small enterprise environments**.  
- Provides high-availability compute, storage, and networking — without the complexity of OpenStack or Kubernetes.

---

## ⚙️ System Requirements

### Minimum
- 8 GB RAM per node  
- One local disk (no partitions)  
- One network interface  
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or newer  

### Production Recommended
- 3 physical nodes for HA  
- 32 GB RAM per node  
- 3 disks per node (OS, local storage, distributed storage) — NVMe recommended  
- 2x 10Gb network interfaces per node (cluster + uplink)  

> 💡 For production: deploy on **bare metal**, separate networks for Ceph and OVN.

---

## 🧠 Planning the Deployment
1. Prepare a worksheet noting each node’s:
   - **IP address**
   - **Network interface assignments**
   - **Disk setup**
2. Configure your nodes' base OS and networking before installing MicroCloud.

---

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### Pre-Work
Your installation targets must have at least Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or newer installed and updated before attempting to install MicroCloud

### 1. Install MicroCloud Components
```bash
sudo snap install lxd microceph microovn microcloud --cohort="+"
```

### 2. Prevent Auto-updates
```bash
sudo snap refresh lxd microceph microovn microcloud --hold
```

### 3. Initialize the First Node
```bash
sudo microcloud init
```
- Configure internal network.
- Select local and distributed storage disks.
- Assign Ceph subnets (internal/public).
- Wait for initialization to finish.

---

## 🧩 Expanding the Cluster

1. On first node:
   ```bash
   sudo microcloud add
   ```
2. On each new node:
   ```bash
   sudo microcloud join
   ```
3. Provide cluster passphrase, select network interfaces, and assign disks.
4. Wait for nodes to sync and complete setup.

---

## 🖥️ Accessing the GUI (LXD UI)
- Access via: `https://<node-IP>:8443`
- Accept self-signed certificate.
- Authenticate using **certificate-based identity**:
  ```bash
  lxc auth identity create tls/lxd-ui --group admins
  ```
- Copy the generated token and paste it into the web UI.

---

## 🔍 LXD UI Tour

- **Dashboard Layout**  
  Left navigation panel with detailed sections per service area.

### Core Sections
- **Instances:** Manage containers and VMs.  
- **Profiles:** Define hardware and configuration templates.  
- **Networks:** Manage bridges, VLANs, and ACLs (acts as firewalls).  
- **Storage:** Manage pools, volumes, and S3-compatible buckets.  
- **Images:** Base OS templates for launching workloads.  
- **Clustering:** View nodes, groups, operations, and warnings.  
- **Permissions:** Manage identities, groups, and IDP integrations.  
- **Settings:** Control global options (including dark mode).

---

## 🧱 Creating Your First Instance

1. Click **“Create Instance.”**
2. Name and optionally describe it.
3. Choose an image (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 LTS).
4. Set as **container** or **VM**.
5. Select desired cluster node or group.
6. Apply a profile (e.g., custom disk size).
7. Click **“Create and Start.”**

You can then:
- Manage configuration (disks, network, GPU passthrough).  
- Use **Terminal** or **Console** to access the instance.  
- View logs and snapshots within the GUI.

---

## 💬 Final Thoughts

### 👍 Pros
- Easy to deploy — runs with a few commands.  
- Intuitive, clean LXD UI.  
- Huge catalog of Linux images (even Windows supported).  
- Supports GPU, USB, PCI passthrough.  
- Great for homelab and small-scale production environments.

### 👎 Cons
- Documentation clarity needs improvement.  
- Lacks built-in monitoring — requires Prometheus/Grafana.  
- GUI only supports certificate-based login (no basic user/password option).
